  Innovation Showcase: The Game-Changing ‘Mermaid Tails’
</h2>

<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-style: italic; color: #ccc;">Revolutionizing Aerodynamics for the 2025 F1 Season</span>

McLaren is excited to announce an upcoming event to unveil the latest aerodynamic breakthrough set to redefine performance in Formula 1: the innovative **mermaid tails** update on our 2025 car.

Join us for an exclusive look at how this subtle yet revolutionary approach to airflow management—featuring vortex-generating curls inspired by natural forms—will optimize downforce, enhance braking cooling, and ultimately change the game on track.

## What Are Mermaid Tails?

The 'mermaid tails' are aerodynamic winglets located at the base of the front wing endplates, designed to efficiently divert airflow outside the front wheels. This concept harnesses a micro-aerodynamic principle reminiscent of a successful technique from F1 history, aiming to optimize airflow outwash and vehicle stability.

*Experience a new dimension in aerodynamic efficiency and witness how innovation continues to push the boundaries of racing technology.*
